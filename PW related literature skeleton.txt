One suggestion to structure the related literature section by stating the (at some time) current optimand/theory, the conflicting empirical evidence (paradoxes) that come along and which reaction it triggered -- kind of a stimulus-response story.

Once upon a time (average) in the 17th century on planet Earth ...

Rational choice codified as using expectation values as the optimand EVT

Stimulus : St. Petersburg lottery comes along

EE-Response to SPL: separation from earlier developments after going back to very first conflicting "evidence" of St. Petersburg lottery -> change optimand to a meaningful observable for typical individual DMs

EE-Response to PW: statistical explanation due to different models of uncertainty

Response to SPL : EUT, i.e. adjust the optimand by introducing utility by keeping its mathematical structure of an expectation value of something intact

Stimulus : Allais paradox, Ellsberg etc.

Response : Bifurcation/separation of K&T "Heuristics & Biases" research programme in behavioural econ from broader bounded rationality programme

Respone by K&T : PT, i.e. adjust the optimand by introducing PW & value function by keeping its mathematical structure of an expectation value of something

Stimulus : Stochastic Dominance issues
Respone by K&T : CPT, i.e. rank-dependent cumulative probabilities, aka special form of PW

Briefly survey what K&T camp has done in the meantime in relation to PW, eg. parameter estimation/calibration

Response by Bounded Rationality Camp (incl. Simon, Gigerenzer, Selten, etc): explore non-optimising behaviour (eg. satisfycing), interpret evidence as adaptive heuristics

Briefly survey what BR camp has done in the meantime related to PW (description-experience gap related to PW)
