One suggestion to structure the related literature section by stating the (at some time) current optimand/theory, the conflicting empirical evidence (paradoxes) that come along and which reaction it triggered -- kind of a stimulus-response story.

Once upon a time (average) in the 17th century on planet Earth ...

Rational choice codified as using expectation values as the optimand EVT

Stimulus : St. Petersburg lottery comes along

EE-Response to SPL: separation from earlier developments after going back to very first conflicting "evidence" of St. Petersburg lottery -> change optimand to a meaningful observable for typical individual DMs

Response to SPL : EUT, i.e. adjust the optimand by introducing utility by keeping its mathematical structure of an expectation value of something intact

Stimulus : Allais paradox, Ellsberg etc.

Response : Bifurcation/separation of K&T "Heuristics & Biases" research programme in behavioural econ from broader bounded rationality programme

Respone by K&T : PT, i.e. adjust the optimand by introducing PW & value function by keeping its mathematical structure of an expectation value of something

Stimulus : Stochastic Dominance issues

Respone by K&T : CPT, i.e. rank-dependent cumulative probabilities, aka special form of PW

Briefly survey what K&T camp has done in the meantime in relation to PW, eg. parameter estimation/calibration

Response by Bounded Rationality Camp (incl. Simon, Gigerenzer, Selten, etc): explore non-optimising behaviour (eg. satisfycing), interpret evidence as adaptive heuristics

Briefly survey what BR camp has done in the meantime related to PW (description-experience gap related to PW)

EE-Response to PW: statistical explanation due to different models of uncertainty



OP:
===
%Tell the story.
-> Many researchers believe PW to be a stable pattern of human behavior. This has been disputed on grounds of poor experimental design and statistical insignificance. Our impression: there is something to this story but the terms of the debate are not well defined, and a deeper understanding is needed to predict with more confidence what effect will be observed in a given situation.

-> We begin with a brief review of the developments in decision theory that led up to cumulative prospect theory. Next, we review existing critiques of CPT, and finally, we add our own critique, which emerges from ergodicity economics. Our critique is aimed at a conceptual element that entered decision theory much earlier than the elements that are more typically critiqued. Specifically, EE rejects the implicit assumption that the expected value of some quantity-- a linear average over the ensemble of possible future values -- is relevant to a decision maker. We insist on physically relevant quantities, which forces us to consider carefully the physical situation of an individual. The obviates the needs for psychological explanations: representing the information available to the decision-maker is enough to make testable predictions of probability weighting.
(We could think of something attractive here, called a promise: what will the reader be able to do/understand after reading our manuscript? A: that psychology, which is problematic because it's subjective and makes no predictions, can be thrown out in many cases)


-> Story of the optimand, up to CPT.

-> Critiques of CPT.
p.5 "Only few studies question..." should be a new paragraph because it's the beginning of critiques.

p.5 "Here we offer..." is part of our critique and should go to the end (or the preview at the beginning).

-> Then all the other critiques (pick an order that makes sense).

-> Finally, our critique "Ergodicity economics". This is, to an extent, a repetition of the paragraph 2, which is ok -- it's called "cycling:" keep exposing the same idea repeatedly from slightly different angles. Each time we get back to it, we point out another feature.
